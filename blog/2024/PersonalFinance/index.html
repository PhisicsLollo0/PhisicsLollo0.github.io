        <p>Hi, I‚Äôm <a href="https://phisicslollo0.github.io/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Lorenzo</a> from Italy üáÆüáπ. Like many young people here, I grew up in an environment where talking about money üí∂ was often considered taboo. But as with many outdated traditions, such as the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/patriarchy" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">patriarchy</a>, I‚Äôve chosen to break the cycle. I‚Äôm determined to demystify money, learn about it, and understand how it influences our lives without letting it become a shadow over our souls üëª.</p>

<h2 id="basic-rules-of-personal-finance">Basic rules of personal finance</h2>

<p>As you might expect, there are no ‚Äúofficial‚Äù rules, as everyone‚Äôs needs, goals, financial situation, and mindset are unique.</p>

<p><em>The personal finance is based on a three rules scheme:</em></p>
<ol>
  <li><em>Track and reduce your spending</em></li>
  <li><em>Improve your income</em></li>
  <li><em>Invest accordingly your objectives</em></li>
</ol>

<h3 id="track-and-reduce-your-spending">Track and reduce your spending</h3>

<p>The first and most essential step in personal finance is to track the cash flowing out of your pockets. While this may seem simple or even trivial, it is anything but. Understanding where your money goes is vital for identifying needs and recognizing areas where you can cut back. It‚Äôs important to note that tracking expenses isn‚Äôt about reducing your lifestyle; it‚Äôs about gathering data to assess your financial balance. With this information at hand, you can thoughtfully set goals and create a strategic plan to achieve them.</p>

<p>Once you‚Äôve tracked your expenses and made cuts where you can or want to, you‚Äôll have a clear picture of your average monthly spending. If you receive a regular salary, you can then calculate your monthly net surplus by subtracting your total expenses from your income. This surplus represents the extra cash available each month that enriches your bank account‚Ä¶. and now?</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="the-four-pillars-of-your-net-worth">The four pillars of your net worth</h2>

<p><em>Add introduction</em></p>

<h3 id="net-worth">Net worth</h3>

<p>An individual‚Äôs net worth is determined by subtracting total liabilities from total assets.
Liabilities encompass various types of debt, such as mortgages, credit card balances, student loans, and car loans. Additionally, liabilities include financial obligations like unpaid bills and taxes that need to be settled. 
An individual‚Äôs assets can include balances in checking and savings accounts, the value of securities such as stocks and bonds, real estate holdings, and the market value of vehicles. Net worth is the amount remaining after all assets are liquidated and personal debts are fully paid off.</p>

<p>This might be confusing, let‚Äôs give some quantitative examples:</p>

<p>For example, consider a student who has no debts and holds ‚Ç¨5,000 in a bank account. Additionally, there is a ‚Ç¨2,000 fund set up by their family in their name. In this case, the student‚Äôs total assets amount to ‚Ç¨7,000 (‚Ç¨5,000 in the bank account + ‚Ç¨2,000 in a separate fund). Since it has no liabilities, its net worth is ‚Ç¨7,000.</p>

<p>Alternatively, consider a 40-year-old individual who owns an inherited house valued at ‚Ç¨250,000 and has ‚Ç¨10,000 in a bank account. However, it has a car loan debt of ‚Ç¨20,000. Its total assets amount to ‚Ç¨260,000, which includes the value of the house and the bank account balance. The total liabilities consist of the ‚Ç¨20,000 car loan. Its net worth is calculated as ‚Ç¨260,000 in assets minus ‚Ç¨20,000 in liabilities, resulting in a net worth of ‚Ç¨240,000.</p>

<p>Simple, isn‚Äôt it? No worries in a few lines it is going to become a nightmare</p>

<h3 id="net-worth-managing">Net worth managing</h3>

<p>Now that we can calculate our net worth and understand our expenses, it‚Äôs natural to ask: How much money should I keep in my bank account? Should I invest the rest? If so, where and how?
These are complex questions without straightforward answers. The most accurate response is, depends. Fortunately, this guide is meant to provoke thought on these topics rather than provide a one-size-fits-all solution. The best part is that you can develop a strategy tailored to your unique circumstances.</p>

<p>To simplify the management of our net worth, we will explore a four-pillar framework. This scheme is inspired by the model presented by <a href="https://www.paolocoletti.com/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Prof. Paolo Coletti</a> in his Personal Finance course available on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfuzpc-H8qcdetz_Zwc5ILnbiG6eek_T8" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">YouTube (‚ÄúEducati e Finanziati‚Äù)</a>, which is offered exclusively in Italian.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>1st pillar</strong>: <em>Cash/Liquidity</em> ‚Äì This represents the funds needed to cover daily expenses and maintain financial stability for routine needs.</li>
  <li>
<strong>2nd pillar</strong>: <em>Emergency found</em> ‚Äì This is a reserve of easily accessible cash set aside for unexpected, significant expenses. It serves as a safety net, allowing you to manage unforeseen financial challenges without disrupting your daily budget or needing to dip into your invested funds.</li>
  <li>
<strong>3rd pillar</strong>: <em>Planned expenses</em> ‚Äì This involves saving and/or safeguarding money for specific future goals or planned expenditures. It ensures that funds are allocated for predetermined purposes, such as a major purchase, vacation, or upcoming life event.</li>
  <li>
<strong>4th pillar</strong>: <em>Invest</em> ‚Äì This refers to money you don‚Äôt need right now and won‚Äôt need for at least 10 years. The goal is to build wealth and generate returns for long-term financial objectives, such as retirement.</li>
</ul>

<div class="l-body-outset" style="height: 500px; overflow: hidden;">
  <img src="/assets/img/Pillars.jpg" alt="Pillars" style="width: 100%; height: 100%; object-fit: cover;">
</div>

<hr>

<h2 id="1st-pillar---cash">1st pillar - Cash</h2>

<p>This is a crucial part of the framework that supports your financial well-being. Each pillar serves a distinct purpose and comes with its own set of guidelines to help you manage your finances effectively.</p>

<p><strong>OBJECTIVES</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Cover daily expenses accommodating for possible small order volatilities (e.g. bills, small trips, etc.)</li>
  <li>Minimize the amount of money that is not needed (and make something out of it)</li>
</ul>

<p>The big question is now‚Ä¶ How many euros should I keep in my bank account? Again, it depends! But there is a simple rule. 
Tracking your expenses provides a clear understanding of your monthly living costs. To maintain financial security, it‚Äôs advisable to keep a reserve in your account equivalent to a multiple of your monthly expenses. This multiple typically ranges from 3 to 12 months‚Äô worth of living costs, depending on your personal circumstances and financial goals.</p>

<p>Below are some examples based on typical individual profiles:</p>

<div class="l-body" style="overflow: hidden;">
  <img src="/assets/img/Types_of_investors.png" alt="Pillars" style="width: 100%; height: 100%; object-fit: cover;">
</div>
<p>See? It really depends. My suggestion is to find what works best for you. This approach will give you peace of mind and help you avoid unnecessary stress about money.
If seeing a low balance in your bank account causes stress, consider adjusting this factor. It has only a minor impact on the overall effectiveness of the strategy but can significantly ease financial anxiety.</p>

<p>So imagine that you spend 600‚Ç¨ per month and you are a ‚ÄúPERSON 1‚Äù type. For you then is not necessary to keep more than ~3000‚Ç¨ in your bank account.</p>

<p>Now, what to do with the rest? That‚Äôs the role of the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th pillar.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="2nd-pillar---emergency">2nd pillar - Emergency</h2>

<p>Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre confident in the ‚Äúlimit‚Äù set for your first financial pillar and decide to invest everything beyond that‚Äîstop right there! What if an unexpected expense of ‚Ç¨2,000 or more arises? This could deplete your first pillar entirely and erode your financial safety margin.</p>

<p>Your instinct might be to liquidate investments from your third and fourth pillars to cover the cost. However, this approach is inefficient and could lead to financial losses (the reasons for this will be explained later).</p>

<p>To fully understand the role of each investment product and determine which ones are most suitable for the remaining pillars, it is essential to delve into the concept of risk in financial investments.</p>

<h3 id="the-digression-of-risk-return-trade-off">The digression of risk-return trade-off</h3>

<p>To fully understand this we first need to introduce two important quantities: <strong>volatility</strong> and <strong>risk</strong>. <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/riskreturntradeoff.asp" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">(Deep dive on it)</a></p>

<p>The <strong>volatility</strong> of an asset refers to the degree of variation in the price of an asset or portfolio over time. It is a statistical measure that indicates the extent of fluctuations in the value of an investment. High volatility means the investment‚Äôs price can change dramatically over a short period in either direction, while low volatility indicates that the price changes at a steadier and more predictable rate. Volatility is commonly measured using standard deviation or variance, and it is often used to assess the risk level associated with an investment.</p>

<p><strong>Risk</strong> in the context of investments refers to the potential for losing some or all of the original investment or the uncertainty regarding the expected returns. It represents the possibility that an investment‚Äôs actual outcome may differ from the expected outcome, including not only financial loss but also underperformance relative to expectations.</p>

<p>High <strong>volatility</strong> and <strong>risk</strong> are often linked, as investments with greater price fluctuations tend to be perceived as riskier. However, this direct correlation primarily holds for short-term periods, such as days, weeks, or perhaps a few years. When examining longer periods of time, the relationship between volatility and risk becomes more complex, requiring the inclusion of a third variable: the <strong>timeframe</strong> of the investment.</p>

<!-- This theme supports rendering beautiful math in inline and display modes using [MathJax 3](https://www.mathjax.org/) engine.
You just need to surround your math expression with `$$`, like `$$ E = mc^2 $$`.
If you leave it inside a paragraph, it will produce an inline expression, just like $$ E = mc^2 $$.

To use display mode, again surround your expression with `$$` and place it as a separate paragraph.
Here is an example:

$$
\left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \right)^2 \leq \left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2 \right) \left( \sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2 \right)
$$

Note that MathJax 3 is [a major re-write of MathJax](https://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/upgrading/whats-new-3.0.html) that brought a significant improvement to the loading and rendering speed, which is now [on par with KaTeX](http://www.intmath.com/cg5/katex-mathjax-comparison.php).

***

## Citations

Citations are then used in the article body with the `<d-cite>` tag.
The key attribute is a reference to the id provided in the bibliography.
The key attribute can take multiple ids, separated by commas.

The citation is presented inline like this: <d-cite key="gregor2015draw"></d-cite> (a number that displays more information on hover).
If you have an appendix, a bibliography is automatically created and populated in it.

Distill chose a numerical inline citation style to improve readability of citation dense articles and because many of the benefits of longer citations are obviated by displaying more information on hover.
However, we consider it good style to mention author last names if you discuss something at length and it fits into the flow well‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâthe authors are human and it‚Äôs nice for them to have the community associate them with their work.

***

## Footnotes

Just wrap the text you would like to show up in a footnote in a `<d-footnote>` tag.
The number of the footnote will be automatically generated.<d-footnote>This will become a hoverable footnote.</d-footnote>

***

## Code Blocks

Syntax highlighting is provided within `<d-code>` tags.
An example of inline code snippets: `<d-code language="html">let x = 10;</d-code>`.
For larger blocks of code, add a `block` attribute:

<d-code block language="javascript">
  var x = 25;
  function(x) {
    return x * x;
  }
</d-code>

**Note:** `<d-code>` blocks do not look good in the dark mode.
You can always use the default code-highlight using the `highlight` liquid tag:


<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">25</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">x</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">x</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="nx">x</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>


***

## Interactive Plots

You can add interative plots using plotly + iframes :framed_picture:

<div class="l-page">
  <iframe src="/assets/plotly/demo.html" frameborder='0' scrolling='no' height="500px" width="100%" style="border: 1px dashed grey;"></iframe>
</div>

The plot must be generated separately and saved into an HTML file.
To generate the plot that you see above, you can use the following code snippet:


<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">pandas</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="n">pd</span>
<span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">plotly.express</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="n">px</span>

## Details boxes 

Details boxes are collapsible boxes which hide additional information from the user. They can be added with the `details` liquid tag:

<details><summary>Click here to know more</summary>
<p>Additional details, where math \(2x - 1\) and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">code</code> is rendered correctly.</p>
</details>

***

## Layouts

The main text column is referred to as the body.
It is the assumed layout of any direct descendants of the `d-article` element.

<div class="fake-img l-body">
  <p>.l-body</p>
</div>

For images you want to display a little larger, try `.l-page`:

<div class="fake-img l-page">
  <p>.l-page</p>
</div>

All of these have an outset variant if you want to poke out from the body text a little bit.
For instance:

<div class="fake-img l-body-outset">
  <p>.l-body-outset</p>
</div>

<div class="fake-img l-page-outset">
  <p>.l-page-outset</p>
</div>

Occasionally you‚Äôll want to use the full browser width.
For this, use `.l-screen`.
You can also inset the element a little from the edge of the browser by using the inset variant.

<div class="fake-img l-screen">
  <p>.l-screen</p>
</div>
<div class="fake-img l-screen-inset">
  <p>.l-screen-inset</p>
</div>

The final layout is for marginalia, asides, and footnotes.
It does not interrupt the normal flow of `.l-body` sized text except on mobile screen sizes.

<div class="fake-img l-gutter">
  <p>.l-gutter</p>
</div>

***

## Other Typography?

Emphasis, aka italics, with *asterisks* (`*asterisks*`) or _underscores_ (`_underscores_`).

Strong emphasis, aka bold, with **asterisks** or __underscores__.

Combined emphasis with **asterisks and _underscores_**.

Strikethrough uses two tildes. ~~Scratch this.~~

1. First ordered list item
2. Another item
‚ãÖ‚ãÖ* Unordered sub-list.
1. Actual numbers don't matter, just that it's a number
‚ãÖ‚ãÖ1. Ordered sub-list
4. And another item.

‚ãÖ‚ãÖ‚ãÖYou can have properly indented paragraphs within list items. Notice the blank line above, and the leading spaces (at least one, but we'll use three here to also align the raw Markdown).

‚ãÖ‚ãÖ‚ãÖTo have a line break without a paragraph, you will need to use two trailing spaces.‚ãÖ‚ãÖ
‚ãÖ‚ãÖ‚ãÖNote that this line is separate, but within the same paragraph.‚ãÖ‚ãÖ
‚ãÖ‚ãÖ‚ãÖ(This is contrary to the typical GFM line break behaviour, where trailing spaces are not required.)

* Unordered list can use asterisks
- Or minuses
+ Or pluses

[I'm an inline-style link](https://www.google.com)

[I'm an inline-style link with title](https://www.google.com "Google's Homepage")

[I'm a reference-style link][Arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]

[I'm a relative reference to a repository file](../blob/master/LICENSE)

[You can use numbers for reference-style link definitions][1]

Or leave it empty and use the [link text itself].

URLs and URLs in angle brackets will automatically get turned into links.
http://www.example.com or <http://www.example.com> and sometimes
example.com (but not on Github, for example).

Some text to show that the reference links can follow later.

[arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]: https://www.mozilla.org

Inline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.

```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```

```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```

```
No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting.
But let's throw in a <b>tag</b>.
```

Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the
raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.

Markdown | Less | Pretty
--- | --- | ---
*Still* | `renders` | **nicely**
1 | 2 | 3

> Blockquotes are very handy in email to emulate reply text.
> This line is part of the same quote.

Quote break.

> This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps. Oh boy let's keep writing to make sure this is long enough to actually wrap for everyone. Oh, you can *put* **Markdown** into a blockquote.


Here's a line for us to start with.

This line is separated from the one above by two newlines, so it will be a *separate paragraph*.

This line is also a separate paragraph, but...
This line is only separated by a single newline, so it's a separate line in the *same paragraph*. -->
