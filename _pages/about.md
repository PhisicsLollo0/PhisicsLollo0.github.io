I am an astrophysicist 🔭 and data scientist 📊 at the [Astronomy Department of the University of Padua](https://www.dfa.unipd.it/en/), with 4+ years of experience in high-level research institutions. My research focuses on the formation, structure, and evolution of the [Milky Way](https://www.britannica.com/place/Milky-Way-Galaxy) galaxy 🌌. To achieve this, I combine simulations built on theoretical principles with observations from large-scale stellar surveys, such as [Gaia](https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Gaia). My work involves reconstructing the history of the Milky Way using stellar data, much like an archaeologist studies Earth's history through fossils. This approach has earned astronomers like me the cool title of Galactic Archaeologists 🏺.

I am a dedicated machine learning and statistics enthusiast who integrates these powerful tools into my research to tackle significant, unresolved questions in astronomy. Explore my [publications 📄](/publications/) to see how machine learning and advance statistical methods push the boundaries of our understanding of the Universe.
